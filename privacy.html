      <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how the developer of the "Sex Diary" application ("Sex Diary", "App", "We", "Us", or "Our") collects, uses, stores, and protects your information when you download, install, register for, or use the App. By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the practices described in this Policy.</p>
      <p><strong>1. Information We Collect</strong><br>
      We are committed to minimizing data collection to protect your privacy. The App collects no personal data from you, except for the following non-identifiable or locally stored information:</p>
      <p><em>1.1 Locally Stored User-Generated Data</em><br>
      All data you input into the App (collectively "User Data") is stored exclusively on your personal mobile device and is never transmitted to, collected, or stored on our servers or any third-party servers. User Data includes, but is not limited to:</p>
      <p>• Details of sexual activities, sex dreams, or masturbation sessions you log;<br>
      • Information about sexual partners you choose to store (e.g., names, preferences);<br>
      • Custom alarm settings;<br>
      • Data generated by the App based on your input (e.g., sexual activity reports).</p>
      <p><em>1.2 Non-Personal, Device-Level Information (Optional, If Applicable)</em><br>
      To provide the "location-based temperature suggestion" feature, the App may request temporary access to your device's location services (only to determine your local temperature). This location data is:<br>
      • Used solely to fetch real-time local temperature from a public weather service (no location coordinates or identifying details are stored);<br>
      • Not transmitted to us or any third parties;<br>
      • Discarded immediately after generating the temperature suggestion;<br>
      • Optional: You may decline location access, and the App will still function (you will only lose access to the temperature suggestion feature).</p>
      <p>We collect no other information (e.g., name, email address, phone number, device ID, IP address, browsing history, or usage analytics) from you or your device.</p>
      <p><strong>2. How We Use Your Information</strong><br>
      The only purpose for which information is used is to enable the App's core features and provide you with a personalized experience—all within your device:<br>
      • User Data: Used to display your logs, generate sexual activity reports, and manage your partner information or custom alarms (all processed locally on your device).<br>
      • Temporary Location Data (if you grant access): Used exclusively to retrieve local temperature data for the "temperature suggestion" feature, with no further use or storage.<br>
      We never use your information for advertising, marketing, data analytics, or any purpose other than supporting the App's intended functionality.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Data Storage and Security</strong><br>
      <em>3.1 Local Storage Only</em><br>
      As emphasized, all User Data remains on your device. We have no access to this data, and it cannot be accessed by us or third parties unless:<br>
      • You intentionally share it (e.g., by transferring device files to another party);<br>
      • Unauthorized access to your device occurs (see Section 3.2 for your security responsibilities).</p>
      <p><em>3.2 Data Security</em><br>
      Your Responsibility: You are solely responsible for securing your device and the User Data stored on it. We recommend using device-level security measures (e.g., passcodes, biometric locks, or App-specific passwords if the App offers this feature) to prevent unauthorized access.<br>
      Data Loss Risks: If you uninstall the App, reset your device, or experience device damage, User Data may be permanently deleted. We strongly advise you to back up User Data regularly (if the App provides a backup feature, such as exporting to your device's local storage).<br>
      No Cloud Sync: The App does not offer cloud sync functionality, meaning User Data cannot be recovered from external servers if lost from your device.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Sharing of Your Information</strong><br>
      We never share, sell, rent, or disclose your information (including User Data and temporary location data) to any third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:<br>
      • Legal Requirements: If required by law, regulation, court order, or valid government request, we may disclose information (though we have no User Data to disclose, as all data is stored locally on your device).<br>
      • Service Providers for App Functionality (If Applicable): If we use a third-party weather service to fetch local temperature data (for the temperature suggestion feature), that service only receives a temporary, non-identifiable request for temperature (no location or user details are shared). These third-party providers are bound by strict data protection obligations and may not use the data for any other purpose.<br>
      No other third parties have access to your information.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Third-Party Services</strong><br>
      The App may integrate with limited third-party services solely to support specific features, but these services do not collect or access your personal data:<br>
      • Public Weather Services: Used to fetch local temperature data (if you grant location access). These services receive no identifying information—only a request for temperature based on a general location (e.g., city-level, not precise coordinates).<br>
      • No Other Third-Party Integrations: The App contains no third-party advertising, analytics tools, social media plugins, or SDKs that collect user data.<br>
      We only work with third-party service providers that comply with global privacy standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, Apple's App Tracking Transparency guidelines, and Google's Play Store Privacy Policy).</p>
      <p><strong>6. Your Rights Over Your Information</strong><br>
      Since all User Data is stored on your device, you have full control over it:<br>
      • Access: You can view all your User Data at any time through the App's interface.<br>
      • Modify/Delete: You can edit or delete any User Data directly within the App (e.g., delete a log entry, remove a partner's information).<br>
      • Export/Backup: If the App provides a backup feature, you can export User Data to your device's local storage (e.g., as a CSV or encrypted file) for safekeeping.<br>
      • Revoke Permissions: You can revoke location access at any time through your device's settings (this will disable the temperature suggestion feature but not affect other App functions).<br>
      • Permanently Delete Data: Uninstalling the App or resetting your device will delete all locally stored User Data (we recommend backing up data first if needed).<br>
      To exercise these rights, no action is required from us—you can manage your data directly through your device or the App.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Children's Privacy</strong><br>
      The App is intended for users aged 18 years or older (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect any information from children under this age, and the App is not designed for use by minors. If we learn that a minor has used the App and provided User Data, we cannot access or delete that data (as it is stored locally on their device)—we recommend that a parent or guardian delete the App from the minor's device to remove the data.</p>
      <p><strong>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong><br>
      We may update this Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App's functionality or applicable privacy laws. When we make changes:<br>
      • We will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Policy;<br>
      • We will notify you by displaying a prominent notice within the App (upon your next launch);<br>
      • We may also send a notification to the email address associated with your App account (if you provided one, though this is not required to use the App).<br>
      Your continued use of the App after the updated Policy takes effect constitutes your acceptance of the changes. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically.</p>
      <p><strong>9. Compliance With Global Privacy Laws</strong><br>
      This Policy is designed to comply with major global privacy regulations, including but not limited to:<br>
      • General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU/EEA): Ensures your right to privacy, data minimization, and local storage of personal data.<br>
      • California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (U.S.): Guarantees your right to know, access, and delete your data, with no sale of personal information.<br>
      • Apple App Store Guidelines: Complies with Apple's requirements for data minimization, local storage, and user consent for location access.<br>
      • Google Play Store Policies: Adheres to Google's standards for privacy protection, transparency, and prohibition of unauthorized data collection.</p>
